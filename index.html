                    What is Flavobacterium?:<br>
                    <br>
                    Flavobacterium is a genus of rod-shaped, gram-negative bacteria. This website was designed to inform you about a certain species of Flavobacterium the Flavobacterium Sp K172, this species of bacteria eats byproducts of nylon production in factories and thus allowing factories to produce less waste. The genus of Flavobacterium are usually found in soil and fresh water in a variety of climates and tempreatures.

                What does Flavobacterium sp K172 do?<br>
                    <br>
                    Flavobacterium sp K172 are a strain of bacterium that are capable of digesting byproducts of nylon 6 manufacture. In simple terms the Flavobacterium sp K172 is able to digest the waste produced while making Nylon 6. Nylon 6 is widley used in different products such as umbrellas and toothbrushes and has become an important part of our society.

                    How does this bacterium do this?<br>
                        <br>
                        What makes the sp K172 special is the enzyme it uses to break down waste, this enyme is known as Nylonase. Scientists believe Nylonase is a product of evolution due to the amount of nylon and chemical waste humans were producing.

                    How does it help the environment?:<br>
                    <br>
                    Nylon production presents many dangers to the environment and factories producing nylon also producs alot of waste aswell. Sp K172 presents us with a way to limit the amount of waste produced and therefore production does not affect the environment as drasctically. The most dangerous byproduct of nylon production is nitrous oxide and since most factories have no use for this chemical it is relases into the atmosphere as waste, nitrous oxide is injurious to the ozone's as it assuts the destruction of the ozone.

                    <br>
                    The strucuture of the Flavobacterium is simmilar to the structure of regular bacterium, here is a helpful diagram to explain to you the structure of the flavobacterium. On the diagram look at the "gram-negative" side as this is the type of bacterium the Flavobacterium is.
